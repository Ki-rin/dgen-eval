  - section: "1. Coherence/Clarity"
    description: "Evaluate whether the output is clear, well-written in English, and follows a logical flow."
    prompt: |
      Evaluate the following output for coherence and clarity:
      Output: {output}
      Criteria:
      - Is the output written in well-structured English?
      - Does it follow a logical flow?

      Provide:
      - **Score**:
        - "1" if the output is written in clear, well-structured English and has a logical flow.
        - "0.5" if there are serious issues in logical flow or clarity but it is still somewhat understandable.
        - "0" only if the output is incomprehensible or not in English.
      - **Comment**: Provide a concise explanation for your score, highlighting examples where logical flow is strong or where clarity could be improved only if necessary.

  - section: "2. Quality Rate"
    description: "Evaluate how well the output addresses the MRM requirements, with a positive bias unless significant gaps exist."
    prompt: |
      Evaluate the following output for quality:
      Output: {output}
      MRM requirements are as follows:
      - {requirements}

      Criteria:
      - Does the output address the MRM requirements at least partially or fully?

      Provide:
      - **Score**:
        - "1" if the output fully addresses the requirements or provides substantial value.
        - "0.5" if there is a serious omission or a critical gap in addressing the requirements.
        - "0" only if it does not address the requirements at all.
      - **Comment**: Provide a concise explanation for your score, emphasizing strengths and identifying specific gaps only if they significantly impact the quality.

  - section: "3. Capture Rate"
    description: "Assess the percentage of requested key items included in the output, favoring outputs that address most requirements."
    prompt: |
      Evaluate the capture rate for the following output, focusing on recognizing and appreciating well-addressed requirements:
      Output: {output}
      MRM requirements are as follows:
      - {requirements}

      Criteria:
      - Identify the total number of requirements (req_total).
      - Identify the number of requirements reasonably addressed in the output (req_output).
      - Calculate Capture Rate as req_output / req_total.

      Note: Assume requirements are addressed unless there is clear evidence they are missing or insufficiently covered.

      Provide:
      - **Score**: Provide the calculated capture rate (1.00 for outputs addressing all requirements, or 0.50 if there is a significant omission). Include only the number without the formula.
      - **Comment**: Provide a concise explanation for your score, emphasizing strengths of the output and noting any serious omissions or issues only if they significantly impact the quality.



f"From the MDD question '{question_cell.value}', define two simple requirements developers must follow in the {section_cell.value} section. 
Example:
Input: 'What are the key assumptions for risk model performance?'
Output:
1. List key performance assumptions clearly.
2. Use simple language for clarity."

section: "3. Capture Rate"
description: "Assess the percentage of requested key items included in the output, favoring outputs that address most requirements."
prompt: |
  Evaluate the capture rate for the following output, focusing on recognizing and appreciating well-addressed requirements:
  Output: {output}
  MRM requirements are as follows:
  - {requirements}
  
  Criteria:
  - Identify the total number of requirements (req_total).
  - Identify the number of requirements reasonably addressed in the output (req_output).
  - Calculate Capture Rate as req_output / req_total.

  Note: Assume requirements are addressed unless there is clear evidence they are missing or insufficiently covered.

  Provide:
  - **Score**: Provide the calculated capture rate (0.90 to 1.00 for outputs addressing most or all requirements unless there are significant omissions). Include only the number without the formula.
  - **Comment**: Provide a concise explanation for your score, emphasizing strengths of the output and noting any serious omissions or issues only if they significantly impact the quality.
