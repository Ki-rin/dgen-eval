Address all aspects mentioned in the question",Our ticket classification system employs a hybrid approach combining natural language processing and traditional machine learning techniques to achieve high accuracy across diverse ticket types.,0.85,0.85,0.85,0.85
3.1. Model Architecture,"Describe the model architecture and technical details:
- What type of model is used?
- Why was this architecture chosen?
- What are the key hyperparameters?
- How was the architecture validated?
","Provide clear information about 3.1. Model Architecture
Address all aspects mentioned in the question","The classification system employs a two-stage architecture:

1. **Stage 1: Text Embedding Generation**

   - Fine-tuned BERT model (bert-base-uncased)
   - Custom layers trained on our support ticket corpus
   - Output: 768-dimensional contextual embeddings

2. **Stage 2: Multi-class Classification**
   - Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (XGBoost)
   - Hyperparameters:
     - max_depth: 6
     - learning_rate: 0.1
     - n_estimators: 200
     - subsample: 0.8
     - colsample_bytree: 0.8

This hybrid architecture was selected after benchmarking against several alternatives:

- Pure transformer-based approach (BERT with classification head)
- Traditional ML with TF-IDF features
- Ensemble methods with various feature combinations

The hybrid approach outperformed alternatives by approximately 8% in overall accuracy and 12% in F1-score for minority classes, while maintaining acceptable inference latency (avg. 120ms per ticket).",0.85,0.85,0.85,0.85
3.2. Training Methodology,"Explain the training methodology:
- What training approach was used?
- How was the data split for training/validation/testing?
- What optimization techniques were employed?
- What stopping criteria were used?
","Provide clear information about 3.2. Training Methodology
Address all aspects mentioned in the question","The model was trained using the following methodology:

1. **Data Splitting**:

   - 70% training set
   - 15% validation set
   - 15% test set
   - Stratified splitting to maintain class distribution

2. **Training Process**:

   - BERT component: Fine-tuned for 3 epochs with learning rate 2e-5
   - XGBoost component: Trained on BERT embeddings + metadata
   - Early stopping based on validation loss (patience: 5 epochs)
   - Learning rate scheduling with cosine decay

3. **Regularization Techniques**:

   - Dropout (rate: 0.2) in BERT layers
   - L2 regularization in XGBoost (lambda: 1.0)
   - Class weights adjusted for imbalanced classes

4. **Infrastructure**:
   - Training performed on 4x NVIDIA A100 GPUs
   - Distributed training using Horovod
   - Mixed precision training (FP16) for efficiency

The training process was logged using MLflow, with all hyperparameters, metrics, and model artifacts stored for reproducibility and compliance purposes.",0.85,0.85,0.85,0.85
