section_2,3.1. Model Architecture,"The classification system employs a two-stage architecture:

1. **Stage 1: Text Embedding Generation**

   - Fine-tuned BERT model (bert-base-uncased)
   - Custom layers trained on our support ticket corpus
   - Output: 768-dimensional contextual embeddings

2. **Stage 2: Multi-class Classification**
   - Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (XGBoost)
   - Hyperparameters:
     - max_depth: 6
     - learning_rate: 0.1
     - n_estimators: 200
     - subsample: 0.8
     - colsample_bytree: 0.8

This hybrid architecture was selected after benchmarking against several alternatives:

- Pure transformer-based approach (BERT with classification head)
- Traditional ML with TF-IDF features
- Ensemble methods with various feature combinations

The hybrid approach outperformed alternatives by approximately 8% in overall accuracy and 12% in F1-score for minority classes, while maintaining acceptable inference latency (avg. 120ms per ticket).","Describe the model architecture and technical details:

section_2,1.1. Objectives and Business Purpose,"The primary objective is to reduce manual ticket routing time by 80%.
This AI classification system aligns with our customer-first strategy by ensuring
timely resolution of support issues. The ML approach was selected because of the
large volume of historical ticket data available.","Describe the objectives and business purpose of the AI component or module.
Evaluate and justify the applicability of the selected AI/ML approach against business objectives and the use of the AI component. 
Specifically, consider the following:
  - The AI component needs to generate adverse action reasons.
  - Certain business drivers (inputs) are expected to have specific functional relationships with the output, such as a variable's key role in clustering.
  - The output is subject to fairness concerns (e.g., Fair Lending).
  - The business use case is subject to system or data limitations.
  - The AI component's use has a large customer/client/employee base or a significant impact on customers/clients/employees.

section_2,2.1. Data Sources and Collection,"The primary data sources for this AI classification system include:

- **Zendesk Ticketing System**: Historical customer support tickets from the past 3 years (2022-2025)
- **Internal Knowledge Base**: Structured metadata about products, services, and common issues
- **Customer Feedback Database**: Post-resolution satisfaction surveys and feedback

Data collection is automated through our ETL pipeline, which extracts new tickets daily at 2:00 AM. The pipeline performs initial cleaning and standardization, including:

- Removal of personally identifiable information (PII)
- Standardization of text formatting and encoding
- Language detection and filtering (English-only for initial model)
- Extraction of metadata (timestamps, product identifiers, initial urgency ratings)

The dataset is refreshed daily with incremental updates, with full retraining performed quarterly.","Describe the data sources used for developing the AI component:
- What are the key data sources?
- How are they collected and preprocessed?
- What is the time period covered by the data?

section_3,2.2. Feature Engineering and Selection,"Feature engineering was conducted through a multi-stage process:

1. **Text Processing**:

   - Tokenization and normalization of ticket content
   - Stop word removal and lemmatization
   - N-gram extraction (unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams)
   - TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) transformation

2. **Metadata Incorporation**:

   - One-hot encoding of categorical variables (product line, customer segment)
   - Time-based features (hour of day, day of week, month)
   - Previous ticket history for the customer (frequency, recency)

3. **Feature Selection**:
   - Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to identify the most predictive features
   - Chi-square test for categorical feature importance
   - Correlation analysis to remove redundant features
   - Domain expert validation of selected features

The final feature set consists of 240 text-based features and 35 metadata features. Feature selection was guided by classification performance metrics, with a focus on minimizing false negatives for critical issue categories.","Explain the feature engineering process:
- What are the key features used in the model?
- How were features engineered and selected?
- What techniques were used for feature selection?
