Data Scope and Feature Engineering,"Describe the data sources and scope for the AI component.
","Provide clear information about Data Scope and Feature Engineering
Address all aspects mentioned in the question","This AI component utilizes a comprehensive dataset of over 1.5 million customer support tickets collected from our enterprise ticketing system. The data spans multiple product lines and service categories, providing a robust foundation for accurate classification.",0.85,0.85,0.85,0.85
2.1. Data Sources and Collection,"Describe the data sources used for developing the AI component:
- What are the key data sources?
- How are they collected and preprocessed?
- What is the time period covered by the data?
- What is the data refresh frequency?
","Provide clear information about 2.1. Data Sources and Collection
Address all aspects mentioned in the question","The primary data sources for this AI classification system include:

- **Zendesk Ticketing System**: Historical customer support tickets from the past 3 years (2022-2025)
- **Internal Knowledge Base**: Structured metadata about products, services, and common issues
- **Customer Feedback Database**: Post-resolution satisfaction surveys and feedback

Data collection is automated through our ETL pipeline, which extracts new tickets daily at 2:00 AM. The pipeline performs initial cleaning and standardization, including:

- Removal of personally identifiable information (PII)
- Standardization of text formatting and encoding
- Language detection and filtering (English-only for initial model)
- Extraction of metadata (timestamps, product identifiers, initial urgency ratings)

The dataset is refreshed daily with incremental updates, with full retraining performed quarterly.",0.85,0.85,0.85,0.85
2.2. Feature Engineering and Selection,"Explain the feature engineering process:
- What are the key features used in the model?
- How were features engineered and selected?
- What techniques were used for feature selection?
- How were features validated for relevance?
","Provide clear information about 2.2. Feature Engineering and Selection
Address all aspects mentioned in the question","Feature engineering was conducted through a multi-stage process:

1. **Text Processing**:

   - Tokenization and normalization of ticket content
   - Stop word removal and lemmatization
   - N-gram extraction (unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams)
   - TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) transformation

2. **Metadata Incorporation**:

   - One-hot encoding of categorical variables (product line, customer segment)
   - Time-based features (hour of day, day of week, month)
   - Previous ticket history for the customer (frequency, recency)

3. **Feature Selection**:
   - Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to identify the most predictive features
   - Chi-square test for categorical feature importance
   - Correlation analysis to remove redundant features
   - Domain expert validation of selected features

The final feature set consists of 240 text-based features and 35 metadata features. Feature selection was guided by classification performance metrics, with a focus on minimizing false negatives for critical issue categories.",0.85,0.85,0.85,0.85
2.3. Data Quality Checks,"Detail the data quality processes:
- What data quality checks are performed?
- How are missing values handled?
- What outlier detection methods are used?
- How are data distributions monitored?
","Provide clear information about 2.3. Data Quality Checks
Address all aspects mentioned in the question","The data pipeline includes the following quality checks:

1. **Completeness Checks**:

   - Missing value detection for all required fields
   - Threshold alerts when missing values exceed 2% of daily volume
   - Automated imputation for non-critical fields (using mode for categorical, mean for numerical)

2. **Consistency Validation**:

   - Range checks for numerical fields
   - Format validation for structured fields (dates, IDs, etc.)
   - Cross-field validation rules for mutually dependent fields

3. **Outlier Detection**:

   - Z-score method for numerical features (threshold: ±3σ)
   - Isolation Forest for multivariate outlier detection
   - Flagging of tickets with unusual patterns for manual review

4. **Distribution Monitoring**:
   - Daily monitoring of feature distributions
   - Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to detect distribution shifts
   - Alerting when distribution shifts exceed predetermined thresholds

Data quality metrics are tracked in a dedicated dashboard with automated alerts for significant deviations. A dedicated Data Quality team reviews flagged issues daily and implements corrective actions when necessary.",0.85,0.85,0.85,0.85
