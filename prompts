  - section: "1. Coherence/Clarity"
    description: "Evaluate if the output is clear, easy to understand, and maintains a logical flow."
    prompt: |
      Evaluate the following output for coherence and clarity:
      Output: {output}
      Criteria:
        - Does the output maintain a clear logical flow?
        - Is it easy to understand?
      Provide:
        - **Score**:
          - "1" if the output is clear and logically structured.
          - "0.5" if it lacks understandability OR the logical flow is flawed.
          - "0" if it lacks understandability AND the logical flow is flawed.
        - **Comment**: Briefly explain the reasoning behind your score.

  - section: "2. Quality Rate"
    description: "Evaluate the degree to which the output provides value in addressing MRM requirements."
    prompt: |
      Evaluate the following output for quality:
      Output: {output}
      Criteria:
        - Does the information present address the MRM requirements (at least partially)?
      Provide:
        - **Score**:
          - "1" if the output fully addresses the requirements.
          - "0.5" if it partially addresses requirements but needs adaptation or improvement.
          - "0" if it does not address the requirements at all.
        - **Comment**: Briefly explain the reasoning behind your score.

  - section: "3. Capture Rate"
    description: "Calculate the percentage of requested key items included in the output."
    prompt: |
      Evaluate the capture rate for the following output:
      Output: {output}
      Criteria:
        - Identify the total number of requirements: {req_total}.
        - Identify the number of requirements met in the output: {req_output}.
        - Calculate Capture Rate as req_output / req_total.
      Provide:
        - **Score**: Provide the calculated capture rate (0.00 to 1.00).
        - **Comment**: Briefly explain the reasoning behind the score, including any missing elements.

  - section: "4. Hallucination Rate"
    description: "Assess whether the output contains fabricated or implausible information."
    prompt: |
      Evaluate the following output for hallucination:
      Output: {output}
      Criteria:
        - Does the output include any fabricated, irrelevant, or implausible details that could not reasonably be inferred?
      Provide:
        - **Score**:
          - "1" if hallucinated content is present.
          - "0" if no hallucination is detected.
        - **Comment**: Briefly explain the reasoning behind your score, specifying any hallucinated content if applicable.
